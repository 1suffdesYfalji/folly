One of the features that the Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub supports is AC97 audio, which is a standard for audio codecs that can be used to provide analog and digital audio signals to and from the computer. AC97 audio is compatible with Intel HD Audio, which is a newer and more advanced standard for audio codecs that can deliver higher quality and more channels of sound[^2^]. The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub contains a set of DMA engines that are used to move samples of digitally encoded data between system memory and external codecs[^2^].
 
The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub can help reduce system noise and heat through more intelligent fan speed control algorithms. It also supports IntelÂ® Quiet System Technology, which can adjust the fan speed according to the system temperature and workload[^3^]. The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub can provide a high-performance and low-power solution for various applications, such as desktops, servers, workstations, mobile devices, and digital home devices[^1^].
  
The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub supports PCI Express\*, which is a high-speed serial interconnect technology that can connect multiple devices on a motherboard or an expansion card. PCI Express\* can provide higher bandwidth and lower latency than the previous PCI and PCI-X standards. The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub supports up to six PCI Express\* ports, each with one or two lanes, depending on the configuration.
 
The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub also supports USB, which is a universal serial bus that can connect various peripheral devices to the computer, such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, cameras, flash drives, and external hard drives. The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub supports up to eight USB 2.0 ports, which can provide data transfer rates of up to 480 Mbps. The Intel 82801g(ICH7) I O Controller Hub also supports USB Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI), which is a specification that defines the interface between the USB host controller and the software driver.
