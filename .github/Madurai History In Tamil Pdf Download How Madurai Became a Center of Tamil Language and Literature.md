## The History of Madurai
 
Madurai has been a continuously inhabited city since at least the 3rd century BCE. It was mentioned by Greek geographer Megasthenes, who visited India during the Mauryan period. Madurai was also referred to as "Methora" by Ptolemy, a 2nd century CE Egyptian astronomer and geographer.
 
Madurai was the seat of power for several dynasties, such as the Pandyas, the Cholas, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Nayaks, and the British. Madurai witnessed many wars, invasions, and cultural exchanges throughout its history. Madurai was also a hub of trade and commerce, connecting South India with other parts of Asia and Europe.
 
Madurai has been a bastion of Tamil culture and language for centuries. It was here that the famous Tamil Sangams (academies of poets and scholars) were held between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE. The Sangam literature, which consists of poems, epics, and grammars, is considered to be one of the oldest and finest examples of Tamil literature. Madurai was also the birthplace or residence of many renowned Tamil poets, such as Thiruvalluvar, Ilango Adigal, Andal, Kambar, and Thirumalai Nayakkar.
 
## The Meenakshi Temple
 
The Meenakshi Temple is one of the most iconic landmarks of Madurai and one of the largest temple complexes in India. It covers an area of about 17 acres and has 14 gopurams (towers) that are adorned with thousands of colorful sculptures depicting gods, goddesses, animals, and mythical creatures. The temple is dedicated to Meenakshi, an incarnation of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, who is worshipped here as Sundareswarar.

The temple has a long and rich history that spans over several centuries. According to legend, the original temple was built by Indra, the king of gods, who was cured of a curse by worshipping a lingam (a symbol of Shiva) made out of sand by a child named Kulasekara Pandya. The child later grew up to become the king of Madurai and expanded the temple. The temple was later destroyed by Muslim invaders in the 14th century CE and rebuilt by the Nayak rulers in the 16th and 17th centuries CE.
 
The temple attracts millions of devotees and tourists every year. It is especially famous for its annual festivals, such as Chithirai Thiruvizha (the celestial wedding of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar), Avani Moolam (the coronation of Sundareswarar), Navaratri (the nine nights of worshiping different forms of Parvati), and Teppam (the float festival).
