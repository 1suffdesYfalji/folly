One of his lesser-known works is a book titled "The Genuine Islam", which was published in 1936 as a collection of his interviews with an Islamic scholar and missionary, Maulana Abdul Aleem Siddiqui. The book contains Shaw's views on Islam, Prophet Muhammad, and the Quran, as well as his predictions about the future of Islam in Europe and the world.
 
In this article, we will review some of the main points and arguments that Shaw makes in his book, and evaluate them from a historical and critical perspective. We will also discuss the relevance and impact of his book in the contemporary context of interfaith dialogue and understanding.
  
## Shaw's Praise of Islam and Prophet Muhammad
 
One of the most striking features of Shaw's book is his high praise of Islam and Prophet Muhammad. He expresses his admiration for the vitality, simplicity, rationality, and universality of Islam as a religion that can appeal to every age and culture. He also acknowledges the achievements and contributions of Islamic civilization in various fields of science, art, literature, and law.
 
Moreover, he shows his respect and reverence for Prophet Muhammad as a great leader, reformer, and savior of humanity. He describes him as a man of wisdom, courage, justice, and compassion who brought a message of peace, tolerance, and equality to the world. He even goes as far as to say that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it much-needed happiness.

He also says that he has studied the life and character of Prophet Muhammad from various biographies and accounts, and found him to be an exemplary model of human excellence.
  
## Shaw's Criticism of Christianity and Western Civilization
 
Another prominent feature of Shaw's book is his criticism of Christianity and Western civilization. He contrasts Islam with Christianity in terms of their doctrines, practices, and histories. He argues that Christianity is a corrupted version of Judaism that has deviated from the original teachings of Jesus Christ. He also criticizes the dogmas, rituals, and institutions of Christianity as irrational, superstitious, and oppressive.
 
He further criticizes Western civilization as a product of Christian influence that has caused much harm and injustice to humanity. He accuses Western powers of exploiting, colonizing, and oppressing other nations and peoples in the name of civilization and progress. He also blames Western culture for spreading materialism, individualism, atheism, and immorality in the world.
 
Shaw's criticism of Christianity and Western civilization is based on his own experience and observation of their effects on society. He was raised in a Protestant family but later rejected Christianity as a religion that did not satisfy his intellectual or spiritual needs. He was also a witness to the horrors of World War I and World War II that resulted from the conflicts and rivalries among Western nations. He was disillusioned with the hypocrisy, violence, and corruption that he saw in Western politics, economics, and culture.
  
## Shaw's Prediction of Islam's Future
 
A final feature of Shaw's book is his prediction of Islam's future in Europe and the world. He states that Islam is the only religion that has the potential to challenge and replace Christianity as the dominant faith in Europe within the next hundred years. He also states that Islam is the only religion that can offer a viable alternative to the secularism and humanism that have eroded the moral values and spiritual foundations of Western society.
 
He bases his prediction on his analysis of the trends and developments that he observes in Europe and the world. He notes that Islam is growing rapidly in terms of population, influence, and appeal
