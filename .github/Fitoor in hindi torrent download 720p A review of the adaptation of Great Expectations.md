## The Plot of Fitoor
 
The film begins with a flashback to Noor's childhood, when he meets Firdaus for the first time at her mother's mansion in Kashmir. Noor is mesmerized by Firdaus' beauty and falls in love with her. However, Begum, who is a bitter and wealthy widow, notices Noor's attraction and decides to use him for her own revenge. She encourages Noor to pursue Firdaus, but also humiliates him for his poverty and low status.
 
Noor grows up to become a talented artist, while Firdaus moves to London to study fashion. Begum arranges for Noor to get a scholarship in Delhi, where he meets Firdaus again after years. Noor hopes to rekindle his love with Firdaus, but she is engaged to Bilal (Oberoi), a Pakistani politician. Noor also learns that Begum is suffering from a terminal illness and wants him to marry Firdaus before she dies.
 
Noor follows Firdaus to London, where he tries to win her back. He also discovers the truth about Begum's past and her motive for manipulating their relationship. He realizes that Begum was once in love with a man named Mufti (Bhat), who betrayed her and married someone else. Begum then killed Mufti's wife and daughter in a fire, leaving him scarred and insane. Firdaus is actually Mufti's daughter, who survived the fire and was adopted by Begum. Begum wanted Noor to break Firdaus' heart, just like Mufti broke hers.
