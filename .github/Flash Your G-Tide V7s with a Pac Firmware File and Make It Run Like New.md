If you have a G-Tide V7s smartphone that is stuck on the boot logo or has a display problem, you may need to flash it with a new firmware. Flashing is the process of installing a new software on your device, which can solve various issues and improve its performance. However, flashing can also be risky if you don't follow the correct steps or use the wrong files.
 
In this article, we will show you how to flash your G-Tide V7s with a pac firmware file that can fix the hang logo and display problems. A pac file is a package file that contains all the necessary files for flashing a Spreadtrum (SPD) device. The G-Tide V7s has a Spreadtrum SP7731 chipset and runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. You will need a computer, a USB cable, and some tools to flash your device.
