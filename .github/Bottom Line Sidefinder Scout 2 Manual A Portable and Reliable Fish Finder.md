1. Turn on the device by pressing the power button on the top right corner of the unit. You will see a welcome screen and then a sonar screen that shows the depth and temperature of the water.
2. Adjust the sensitivity of the sonar by pressing the up or down arrow buttons on the left side of the unit. The sensitivity determines how much detail and noise you will see on the screen. A higher sensitivity will show more fish and structure, but also more clutter and interference. A lower sensitivity will show less detail, but also less noise. You can also use the auto mode by pressing the auto button on the right side of the unit, which will automatically adjust the sensitivity based on the water conditions.
3. Adjust the range of the sonar by pressing the range button on the right side of the unit. The range determines how far you can see on the screen horizontally and vertically. You can choose from four preset ranges: 30, 60, 120, and 240 feet. You can also use the zoom mode by pressing the zoom button on the right side of the unit, which will magnify a selected area of the screen.
4. Read the sonar screen by looking at the symbols and colors that indicate different objects and features. The screen is divided into two sections: a side-scan section on the left and a depth sounder section on the right. The side-scan section shows what is on either side of your boat, while the depth sounder section shows what is below your boat. The symbols are as follows:
    - A fish symbol indicates a fish or a school of fish. The size and color of the symbol indicate the size and depth of the fish. A larger symbol means a larger fish, and a darker color means a deeper fish.
    - A line or curve indicates a bottom contour or a structure. The shape and color of the line or curve indicate the shape and depth of the bottom or structure. A straight line means a flat bottom, and a curved line means a sloped or uneven bottom. A darker color means a deeper bottom or structure.
    - A dot or cluster of dots indicates debris or vegetation. The size and color of the dot or cluster indicate the size and depth of the debris or vegetation. A larger dot or cluster means more debris or vegetation, and a darker color means deeper debris or vegetation.
5. Use the side-scan sonar to locate fish and structure on either side of your boat. The side-scan sonar can scan up to 120 feet away from your boat in both directions, giving you a 240-foot wide view of what is around you. You can switch between left and right views by pressing the left or right arrow buttons on the left side of the unit. You can also use both views simultaneously by pressing both buttons at once.
6. Use the depth sounder to measure the water depth and temperature below your boat. The depth sounder can measure up to 240 feet deep, depending on your range setting. You can see the depth reading on the top right corner of the screen, and the temperature reading on
the bottom right corner of the screen.

The Bottom Line Sidefinder Scout 2 fish finder is a handy tool for anglers who want to explore shallow water and find fish and structure with ease. It is simple to use and has a clear display that shows you what is around you in real time. With this device, you can improve your fishing success and enjoy your time on the water.
