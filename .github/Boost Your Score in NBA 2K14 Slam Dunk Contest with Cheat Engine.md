Open Cheat Engine and click on the "Select a process to open" button on the top left corner. A list of processes will appear. Look for the one that says "nba2k14.exe" and click on it. Then click on "Open".
 
## Step 2: Scan for the Dunk Score Value
 
Now you need to find the value of your dunk score in the game's memory. To do this, go to NBA 2K14 and start the Slam Dunk Contest mode. Choose your player and your opponent, and wait for your turn to dunk. When you are ready, press "Space" to start your dunk attempt.
 
As soon as you finish your dunk, pause the game and look at your score on the screen. It should be a number between 0 and 50. Remember this number and go back to Cheat Engine. In the "Value" box, type in your score and click on "First Scan". A list of addresses will appear on the left panel. These are the possible locations of your score value in the memory.
 
## Step 3: Narrow Down the Results
 
Now you need to find the exact address of your score value among the results. To do this, go back to NBA 2K14 and resume the game. Wait for your next turn to dunk and try a different dunk. Pause the game again and look at your new score.
 
Go back to Cheat Engine and type in your new score in the "Value" box. Click on "Next Scan". The list of addresses will shrink, as only the ones that match your new score will remain. Repeat this process until you have only one address left on the list. This is the address of your score value.
 
## Step 4: Change the Score Value
 
Now that you have found the address of your score value, you can change it to whatever you want. To do this, double-click on the address on the list. It will move to the bottom panel, where you can edit it. In the "Value" box, type in any number between 0 and 50 that you want as your score. For example, if you want a perfect score of 50, type in 50.
 
Go back to NBA 2K14 and resume the game. You will see that your score has changed to the number you entered in Cheat Engine. You can do this for every dunk attempt you make, and easily win the Slam Dunk Contest with amazing scores.
