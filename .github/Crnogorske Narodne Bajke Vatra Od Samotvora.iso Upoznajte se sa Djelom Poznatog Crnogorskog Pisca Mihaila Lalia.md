One of the most popular and mysterious folk tales from Montenegro is the story of the fire of Samotvor, a magical flame that can cure any illness or curse. The tale is part of the anthology "Crnogorske Narodne Bajke" (Montenegrin Folk Tales), which was compiled by Radoje Radojevic and published in 2012.
 
The story follows a young prince who falls ill with a strange disease that no doctor can heal. His father, the king, sends messengers to all corners of the world to find a remedy, but none of them returns. One day, a mysterious old man appears at the palace and tells the king that the only cure for his son is the fire of Samotvor, a flame that burns in a hidden cave in the mountains. The old man warns the king that the fire is guarded by a fearsome dragon and that only a brave and pure-hearted hero can obtain it.
