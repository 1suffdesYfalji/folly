N.W.A., the rap group that called itself "the world's most dangerous group", released their debut album *Straight Outta Compton* in 1988. The album was a groundbreaking work of gangsta rap that depicted the harsh realities of life in the streets of Compton, Los Angeles. The album also sparked controversy for its explicit lyrics, especially the track "Fuck tha Police", which provoked an FBI warning letter and a ban from many radio stations.
 
The album was produced by N.W.A. members Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, and Arabian Prince, with lyrics written by N.W.A. members Ice Cube and MC Ren along with Ruthless Records rapper The D.O.C. The album featured Eazy-E as the main vocalist, delivering his rhymes with a high-pitched voice and a charismatic attitude. The album also introduced the world to Ice Cube's sharp and witty storytelling, MC Ren's aggressive and confident flow, and Dr. Dre's innovative and influential beats.

After the release of *Straight Outta Compton*, N.W.A. faced internal conflicts and legal disputes that led to the departure of Ice Cube in 1989 and Dr. Dre in 1991. The remaining members (Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella) pursued solo careers, sometimes rejoining to collaborate on new music. (Assisted by DJ Yella, Eazy-E saw the greatest success of the three.)[^2^]
 
Ice Cube became one of the most influential and successful solo rappers of the early 1990s, releasing albums such as *AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted*, *Death Certificate*, and *The Predator*. He also started his acting career with roles in films such as *Boyz n the Hood*, *Friday*, and *Three Kings*. He later formed a rap group called Westside Connection with WC and Mack 10, and continued to release solo albums throughout the 2000s and 2010s.[^3^]
 
Dr. Dre became one of the most influential and successful producers in hip-hop history, co-founding Death Row Records with Suge Knight and launching the careers of Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur, and Tha Dogg Pound. He also released his own solo album, *The Chronic*, which is widely regarded as a classic. He later left Death Row to form his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, where he signed Eminem, 50 Cent, The Game, and Kendrick Lamar. He also released another solo album, *2001*, and a collaborative album with Eminem, *Relapse*. He also co-founded Beats Electronics with Jimmy Iovine, which was sold to Apple for $3 billion in 2014.
 
Eazy-E continued to run Ruthless Records and released two solo albums, *Eazy-Duz-It* and *It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa*. He also feuded with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, dissing them on several songs. He later reconciled with them before his death from AIDS-related complications in 1995.[^2^]
 
MC Ren released four solo albums between 1992 and 2009, as well as an EP with Public Enemy's Chuck D in 2014. He also appeared on several songs by other artists, such as Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, and DJ Premier.
 
DJ Yella produced Eazy-E's solo albums and some songs for other Ruthless artists. He also directed several pornographic films in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He returned to music production in 2011 and released an album called *West Coastin'* in 2012.
 
Arabian Prince left N.W.A. before the release of *Straight Outta Compton*, due to creative differences. He released several solo albums and singles between 1989 and 2007. He also worked as a producer for other artists, such as JJ Fad, Bobby Jimmy & the Critters, and Professor X.
