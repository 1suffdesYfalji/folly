NEN 1010 is a Dutch standard that specifies the requirements for electrical installations for low-voltage. It is based on the international standard HD-IEC 60364 series, but it also includes some national deviations and additions. NEN 1010 is not mandatory, but it provides guidance and best practices for the design, installation, expansion, and inspection of low-voltage electrical installations. It also ensures the safety of people, animals, and property from electrical hazards.
  
NEN 1010 covers various aspects of electrical installations, such as:

- General principles and definitions
- Protection against electric shock, overcurrent, overvoltage, and fire
- Selection and erection of equipment and wiring systems
- Special installations and locations, such as medical premises, swimming pools, solar photovoltaic systems, etc.
- Inspection and testing of electrical installations

NEN 1010 is updated regularly to reflect the latest technological developments and regulations. The current version is NEN 1010:2020 nl, which was published in April 2021 and consists of 835 pages[^1^]. It replaces the previous version NEN 1010:2015 nl and its amendments[^1^]. NEN 1010:2020 nl is available in Dutch language only and can be purchased online as a PDF or a paper document from the official website of NEN[^1^].

NEN 1010 is a useful and reliable reference for anyone involved in electrical installations for low-voltage, such as electricians, engineers, contractors, inspectors, consultants, etc. It helps to ensure that electrical installations are safe, efficient, and compliant with the relevant laws and regulations. By following NEN 1010, you can avoid potential risks and liabilities that may arise from faulty or inadequate electrical installations.
  
## Examples of electrical installations for low-voltage
  
Electrical installations for low-voltage can be found in various types of buildings and systems, such as residential, commercial, industrial, public, and special applications. Some examples of electrical installations for low-voltage are:

- Lighting systems: Low-voltage lighting systems use LED lamps, halogen lamps, or fluorescent lamps that operate at lower voltages than conventional incandescent lamps. Low-voltage lighting systems can offer energy savings, longer lamp life, and better lighting quality. They can also be controlled by dimmers, sensors, timers, or remote devices.
- Communication systems: Low-voltage communication systems include telephone lines, data networks, intercoms, audio-visual systems, security systems, fire alarm systems, and access control systems. Low-voltage communication systems enable the transmission and reception of voice, data, video, and signals over wires or wireless devices. They can also provide safety and security features for the occupants and the property.
- Power supply systems: Low-voltage power supply systems include transformers, inverters, converters, batteries, solar panels, generators, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). Low-voltage power supply systems provide electrical power to low-voltage equipment and devices. They can also convert the voltage level from one source to another, store electrical energy for backup or emergency use, or produce electrical energy from renewable sources.

NEN 1010 provides specific requirements and recommendations for each type of electrical installation for low-voltage. By following NEN 1010, you can ensure that your electrical installation for low-voltage is safe, efficient, and compliant with the relevant laws and regulations.
