RAGE 2 TerrorMania-CODEX is the latest release of the action-packed first-person shooter game developed by Avalanche Studios and id Software. This release is standalone and includes all content and DLC from previous releases and updates. It also introduces a new expansion called TerrorMania, where players can explore a twisted version of the wasteland called the Deadlands.
 
In TerrorMania, players will have to face off against undead versions of familiar enemies, such as Goon Squad, Immortal Shrouded, River Hogs and Abadon Muties. They will also encounter new threats, such as the skeletal Swordsmen, who wield a powerful sword that can cut through anything. To fight back, players will need to find and wield their own magic sword, the Sword of Transitus, which can also unlock portals to the Deadlands.

The Deadlands is a dark and dangerous realm, where reality is distorted and the landscape is haunted by floating islands, shattered bridges and ghostly ruins. Players will have to traverse this hostile environment using their vehicles, weapons and abilities, while searching for fragments of the shattered NecroDisc, which can restore the balance between worlds.
 
RAGE 2 TerrorMania-CODEX also includes other features and content from the base game and previous DLCs, such as the Rise of the Ghosts expansion, which adds a new story, region and faction; the BFG 9000 from DOOM; the Cult of the Death God mission; the Reaper Assault Rifle; the Wasteland Celebrity Phoenix vehicle skin; and the Mutant Monster Truck vehicle skin.
